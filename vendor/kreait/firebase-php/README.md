## Overview

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) provides the tools and infrastructure you need to develop your app, grow your user base, and earn money. The Firebase Admin PHP SDK enables access to Firebase services from privileged environments (such as servers or cloud) in PHP.

For more information, visit the [Firebase Admin PHP SDK documentation](https://firebase-php.readthedocs.io/).

## Installation

The recommended way to install the Firebase Admin SDK is with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies
your project needs and installs them into your project.

```bash
composer require "kreait/firebase-php:^8.0"
```

Please continue to the [Setup section](docs/setup.rst) to learn more about connecting your application to Firebase.

If you want to use the SDK within a Framework, please follow the installation instructions here:

- **Laravel**: https://packagist.org/packages/kreait/laravel-firebase
- **Symfony**: https://packagist.org/packages/kreait/firebase-bundle

## Quickstart

```php
use Kreait\Firebase\Factory;

$factory = (new Factory)
    ->withServiceAccount('/path/to/firebase_credentials.json')
    ->withDatabaseUri('https://my-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com');

$auth = $factory->createAuth();
$realtimeDatabase = $factory->createDatabase();
$cloudMessaging = $factory->createMessaging();
$remoteConfig = $factory->createRemoteConfig();
$cloudStorage = $factory->createStorage();
$firestore = $factory->createFirestore();
```
